# End-to-end testing

- We develop end-to-end tests with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev)
- They are located in the [e2e/tests](./tests) folder.
- [Playwright fixtures](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures) (like page objects) are in the [e2e/fixtures](./fixtures) folder.

Several configurations are provided in the [e2e/config](./config) folder, depending on:

- where the tests are launched (locally or CI build),
- against which environment they should be launched (local host, dev, ops or prod).

When developing tests locally, we use a [Pyroscope server with static data](../docker-compose.e2e.yaml) (2023-11-11 09:00 ‚Üí 2023-11-11 13:00), to have deterministic and predictable tests.

## Develop tests locally

### Setup, only once

Install Playwright with Chromium:

```shell
yarn e2e:local:prepare
```

To launch the tests against your local environment, set these variables in the `.env` file:

```shell
E2E_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
E2E_USERNAME=user
E2E_PASSWORD=pass
```

To launch the tests against a non-local environment (dev, ops, prod):

- Open 1Password
- Search for "E2E Pyroscope", choose the enviroment you want to target
- Set these values to the `.env` file

By doing so, an [authentication step](https://playwright.dev/docs/auth) will automatically be added before launching the tests.

### Each time you want to develop a new test

Start the app, in one terminal window:

```shell
yarn && yarn dev
```

And in another terminal tab, start the server:

```shell
yarn e2e:local:server
```

Run the tests in interactive UI mode (with a built-in watch mode):

```shell
yarn e2e:local:watch
```

You can also run the [code generator](https://playwright.dev/docs/codegen#running-codegen):

```shell
yarn e2e:local:codegen
```

If you write tests that generate screenhots, please read the next section.

### Screenshots testing

We have to launch Playwright in Docker in order to generate screenshots.

By doing so, we ensure that the screenshots generated always match the ones that will be generated during the CI build:

```shell
yarn e2e:ci:server:up
yarn e2e:ci

# then once finished
yarn e2e:ci:server:down
```

The screenshots will be generated in subfolders within the [e2e/tests](./tests) folder, next to their corresponding tests.

### CI build

In build time (PR and main branch), we run a [Pyroscope server with static data](../docker-compose.e2e.yaml) (2023-11-11 09:00 ‚Üí 2023-11-11 13:00). This allows us to launch deterministic and predictable tests.
