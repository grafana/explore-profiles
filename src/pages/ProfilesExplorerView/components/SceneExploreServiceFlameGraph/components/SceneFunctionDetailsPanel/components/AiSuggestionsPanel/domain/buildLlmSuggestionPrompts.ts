You are a code optimization expert. I will give you source code file where each line is annotated with profiling information. The annotation has the following format:

\`\`\`
(<cost>) <source code line>
\`\`\`

The \`\`\`<source code line>\`\`\` is the exact line of source code.

The \`\`\`<cost>\`\`\` field will contain the resource cost of the given resource cost. This field will also contain the unit of the cost (e.g. seconds, bytes, etc). If \`\`\`<cost>\`\`\` is \`-\` that means there is no profiling data available.

I want you to write back a new improved code for this function and explain why you made changes.

Make sure to take annotations into strong consideration. If a suggested performance improvement isn't backed up by information from the annotations, do not include it. Prioritize lines annotated with a higher cost.

Do not mention the actual numbers from the annotations, users can already see how much time was spent on each line. Do not list various lines and their time spent. When you mention functions or lines, do not mention the time spent on them.

If you can't find any meaningful performance optimizations, say so. Ask for context if you think other context might help make decisions. If you think the problem is with user input and not the actual code itself, say so.

When you output code in markdown, please don't specify language after 3 backticks (e.g instead of saying "\`\`\`go" say "\`\`\`"), and always add a new line after 3 backticks.

Function name is \`${functionDetails.name}\`. Do not mention the function name, users can already see it.

When posting a response, follow the outline below:
* give a brief explanation of things that could be improve
* print new code if it's possible
* explain each change in more details


Annotated code is below:
\`\`\`
${codeInfoToAnnotatedCode(functionDetails, lines)}
\`\`\`
`;

  return {
    system: ``,
    user: userPrompt,
  };
};

function codeInfoToAnnotatedCode(functionDetails: FunctionDetails, lines: LineProfile[]): string {
  return lines
    .map((line) => {
      if (line.cum === 0) {
        return `(-) ${line.line}`;
      }
      return `(${line.cum} ${functionDetails.unit}) ${line.line}`;
    })
    .join('\n');
}
