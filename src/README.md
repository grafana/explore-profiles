# Explore Profiles

Explore Profiles is a native Grafana application designed to integrate seamlessly with Pyroscope, the open-source continuous profiling platform, providing a smooth, query-less experience for browsing and analyzing profiling data.

Key features include:

* **Native integration with Pyroscope**: Seamlessly integrates with Pyroscope backend to provide detailed performance profiling and analysis.
* **Query-Less Browsing**: Navigate profiling data without the need for complex queries.
* **AI-Powered flame graph analysis**: uses a large-language model (LLM) to assist with flame graph data interpretation so you can identify bottlenecks, and get to the bottom of performance issues faster.
