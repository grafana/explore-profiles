# Profiles Drilldown

Profiling is a technique used in software development to measure and analyze the runtime behavior of a program.
By profiling a program, developers can identify which parts of the program consume the most resources, such as CPU time, memory, or I/O operations.
You can use this information to optimize the program, making it run faster or use fewer resources.
