# Get started with Explore Profiles

Profiles can help you identify errors in your apps and services.
Using this information, you can optimize and streamline your apps.

Your investigation begins with the big picture and then drills down using profile types, labels, and flame graphs to explore your data. To learn more, refer to [Concepts](../concepts/).
