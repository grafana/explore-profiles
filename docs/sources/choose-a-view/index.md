# Choose a view

The available views in Explore Profiles correspond to how you move through your data: from broader to more specific.
For example, you can start with **All services** and then move to **Profile types** or **Labels** for more specific views into your data.

This matches the hierarchy of the [profiling data](../concepts/).

After you choose a view, you can [Investigate trends and spikes](../investigate/).

{{< docs/public-preview product="Explore Profiles" >}}

## Select a view

Select a view by choosing an **Exploration**: **All services**, **Profile types**, **Labels**, **Flame graph**, or **Diff flame graph**.

<!-- screenshots need to be updated -->

You can refine any selected views by selecting a Profile type, Label, or Flame graph from one of the charts.
Click and drag on an area of interest to see more detail.

Determining which view to use frames the rest of your investigation.

## Exploration type examples

### All services view

The **All services** view is the default view when you first open Explore Profiles.

### Profile types

The Profile types shows one chart for each profile available for the selected service.
You can select to display the charts in a grid or one chart per row.

![Profile types](../images/explore-profiles-profile-types.png)

### Labels

The Labels view lets you navigate and analyze performance data through labels.
This feature is crucial for identifying performance anomalies and understanding the behavior of different application segments under various conditions.

### Flame graphs

The Flame graph view visualizes profiling data of a single service in a flame graph format, allowing easy identification of resource-intensive functions.

On views with a flame graph, you can use **Explain flame graph** to provide an AI flame graph analysis that explains the performance bottleneck, root cause, and recommended fixes.
For more information, refer to [Flame graph AI](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/monitor-applications/profiles/flamegraph-ai/).

You can also use line-level insights from the [GitHub integration](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/monitor-applications/profiles/pyroscope-github-integration/).

### Diff flame graph

The **Diff flame graph** view shows the differences between two profiling data sets.
It normalizes the data by comparing the percentage of total time spent in each function so that the resulting flame graph is comparing the share of time spent in each function rather than the absolute amount of time spent in each function.
This lets you compare two different queries that may have different total amounts of time spent in each function.

Similar to a `git diff`, it takes the selected flame graphs and highlights the differences between them.

<!-- from old screenshot of cpu usage profile Red represents an increase in CPU usage from the baseline to the comparison and green represents a decrease. -->

### Favorites

The **Favorites** view shows all your favorited visualizations. 
Clicking on the star (⭐️) at the top-right corner of a visualization saves it as a favorite.

This feature helps you creating an overview of what's important, as well as offering the possibility to quickly jump to the **Flame graph** view or the **Labels** view.
