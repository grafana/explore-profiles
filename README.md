# Explore Profiles

Explore Profiles is a native Grafana application designed to integrate seamlessly with [Pyroscope](https://github.com/grafana/pyroscope), the open-source continuous profiling platform, providing a smooth, query-less experience for browsing and analyzing profiling data.

## Install Explore Profiles

Explore Profiles is distributed as a Grafana Plugin. You can find it in the official [Grafana Plugin Directory](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/grafana-pyroscope-app/).

### Install in [Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/products/cloud/)

All Grafana Cloud instances come with Explore Profiles plugin preinstalled.

### Installation in your Grafana instance

You can install Explore Profiles in your own Grafana instance using `grafana-cli`:

```shell
grafana-cli plugins install grafana-pyroscope-app
```

Alternatively, you can do it via Grafana UI by following these steps:

1. Within Grafana, go to Administration > Plugins and data > Plugins.
2. Search for "Explore Profiles".
3. Click on "Explore Profiles".
4. Click on "Install" button.

### Install using environment variables

If you want to install the app in a docker container, you need to configure the following environment variable:

```shell
GF_INSTALL_PLUGINS=grafana-pyroscope-app
```

## Getting Started

1. In the main navigation bar, click on Explore > Profiles.
2. Youâ€™ll land in the service overview page that shows time series and CPU utilization visualizations for all the services in your selected Pyroscope instance.
3. Change your data source with the drop-down on the top left.
4. Modify your time range in two ways:
  * Use the standard time range picker on the top right.
